You can find it under the Legacy Responsive Web Design section. <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/responsive-web-design-updates/508345">We encourage you to read about the changes we made and consider exploring the updated curriculum.</a></p>

                <p>In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.</p>
                <p>First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.</p>
                <p>Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox, and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.</p>

                <p>Note: Some browser extensions, such as ad-blockers and dark mode extensions can interfere with the tests. If you face issues, we recommend disabling extensions that modify the content or layout of pages, while taking the course.</p>
